Netplan is the default network configuration tool in modern Ubuntu versions. Here's how to set a static IP:
1.	Open the Netplan configuration file:
The configuration files are located in /etc/netplan/. Typically, the file is named 01-netcfg.yaml or 50-cloud-init.yaml.

sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml

2.	Edit the file:
Modify the file to include your static IP configuration. Here's an example:
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:  # Replace with your network interface name (use `ip a` to check)
      dhcp4: no
      addresses:
        - 192.168.1.100/24  # Replace with your desired static IP and subnet mask
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1  # Replace with your gateway IP
      nameservers:
        addresses:
          - 8.8.8.8  # Replace with your DNS server(s)
          - 8.8.4.4
o	Replace enp0s3 with your actual network interface name (use ip a or ifconfig to find it).
o	Adjust the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS servers as needed.
3.	Apply the changes:
After saving the file, apply the configuration with:
sudo netplan apply
